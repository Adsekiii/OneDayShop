# OneDayShop

## Overview

OneDayShop is an ASP.NET project we built during a 24-hour coding challenge. It's a great example of how to quickly develop and solve problems using ASP.NET.
We worked together, [@wjakubowicz](https://github.com/wjakubowicz) and [@Adsekiii](https://github.com/Adsekiii), to learn and use new technologies in a short amount of time.

## Our Thoughts

- wjakubowicz: It was my first ASP.NET project, and I learned a lot about the technology.
I had previous experience working with the Django framework in Python and I found ASP.NET to be quite similar in many aspects.
I enjoyed working with Adsekiii and building this project together. I'm proud of what we accomplished in such a short time. 

- Adsekiii: Even though it was a somewhat spontaneous idea, we chose to proceed with it.
At first, the project appeared to be quite challenging because it was my first experience with ASP.NET.
However, as I continued to write code, my understanding improved, leading to a deeper grasp of the language.
We decided to limit our viewing of tutorials and instead focus on documentation and StackOverflow,
which enhanced our understanding of the topic. Initially, I had reservations about this project due to my inexperience with C#.
Nevertheless, I discovered that C# is very similar to Java, and the skills I had developed while using Unity were also beneficial.
It was a pleasure working with wjakubowicz :D

## Epilogue

Due to the unforeseen circumstances, we were unable to complete all the features we had planned.
However, we are proud of what we accomplished in such a short time.
In the future, we may consider revisiting this project to incorporate additional features and enhance the existing ones in a separate repository.
This approach will ensure that the current repository remains true to its original purpose as a 24-hour challenge.
(Even though it was closer to 10 hours due to our chores ^_- )
