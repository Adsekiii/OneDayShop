# OneDayShop

## Overview

OneDayShop is an ASP.NET project we built during a 24-hour coding challenge. It's a great example of how to quickly develop and solve problems using ASP.NET.
We worked together, [@wjakubowicz](https://github.com/wjakubowicz) and [@Adsekiii](https://github.com/Adsekiii), to learn and use new technologies in a short amount of time.
